# Homework-ArrayList-01
The CodingBats in this folder all involve use of the `ArrayList`. As CodingBat does not support `ArrayList`s as data types for parameters, in many cases `List`, the interface which `ArrayList` implements, is used instead.

These CodingBats come from Tony Smith of Career Center High School in Winston-Salem, NC ([tlsmith2@wsfcs.k12.nc.us](https://codingbat.com/home/tlsmith2@wsfcs.k12.nc.us)), specifically his [homework-arraylist-01](https://codingbat.com/home/tlsmith2@wsfcs.k12.nc.us/homework-arraylist-01) collection.
