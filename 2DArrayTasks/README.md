1. Work on the SumRowsAndColumns.java tasks first. 

2.  Work on the GridOfObject.java tasks in this order:

    2. MoveEverybody() - Focus just on making sure that you are not looking out of bounds along the edges of the 2D Array
    3. AssignNeighbors()
    4. Complete MoveEverybody() as it is asked to be written.
